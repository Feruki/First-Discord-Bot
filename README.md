# First-Discord-Bot

This is my first attempt at a pretty simple discord bot.

It's primary focus was just to assign Class roles for the game 'Lost Ark' on a smaller discord server we ran for one of our sub guilds (Roughly 30 members).

It has a added "fun" thing which randomly insults people pulling from two different APIs as well as some more standard commands like ban, kick and timeout.


Might work on it further, I'm not sure, it was just my first try after learning JS in my 3rd semester of uni for a bit, it did its job and that's what I'm fine with for now.
Obviously many things can be improved, but as I said for a small scale server like I am using it right now it works fine as is.
